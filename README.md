<h1>Day 29 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</h1>
<p>For the Day 29 challenge, I created a Password Manager that allows you to store your account details and generate complex passwords for you! This is a culmination of the teaching points that were shared in the tutorial, including the following but not limited to</p>
<ul>
  <li>tkinter library and Graphical User Interface</li>
  <li>conditional statements</li>
  <li>pyperclip library that allowed me to automatically copy the randomly generated passowrd</li>
</ul>

> [!TIP]
> It can be tricky to deal with function especially figuring out how to extract values that you generate using functions. I thought the print function was really helpful when I test my code as it allowed me to configure why there were times when commands were executed after buttons were pressed but the values were not returned. For instance, I figured that edits to the field (e.g., Insert method) should be housed inside the function and not outside as the command function only runs the function but does not allow you to store results from the function.

<h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
<p>I have learned python before in school but I hope to revisit some of the python concepts that I may have forgotten and at the same time delve further into python, especially in the field of data science and visualisation.</p>
